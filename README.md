This is my (Jerome Sipin)'s submission for the web scraping homework.

Within the 'mission_to_mars.ipynb' file, the original code used to scrape the
various Mars websites can be found.

The version used for the Flask application can be found in the 'scrape_mars.py',
which has been lightly modified to return information for Flask to use. The main
Flask application is found in 'app.py'. The templates itself and the CSS used
can be found in the /templates folder.
